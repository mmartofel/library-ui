# Patterns

How the method was built and what was learned. This template was extracted from **Person UI**
(`spring-person-ui-claude`, against `spring-person-api-claude`, Person API 3.4.1): its two resources are now the
reference examples in `.claude/skills/crud-resource/references/examples/` (`persons`, `tasks`). Copy them, do not
reinvent them. Conventions are in `CLAUDE.md`.

Sections 2 and 3 are that app's history: paths such as `src/features/persons/` and stage numbers refer to it. Add
your project's lessons to section 3 and keep section 4 (what the manifest can express) current.

## 1. Adding a resource

The `crud-resource` skill (`.claude/skills/crud-resource/`) runs these steps; keep it in step with this section.
Contract rules are in `docs/API-CONTRACT.md`, checked by the `contract-auditor` agent.

Example: a resource `orders` with API tag `Orders`. Steps 1–3 come before any screen code.

1. **Contract.** The API must already expose the resource. `npm run contract:pull && npm run api:generate`, then commit
   `contract/openapi.json` and `src/api/generated/`. Check what the contract gives you:
   - required fields;
   - enums;
   - `format: date`;
   - field error `code`s.
   Anything the UI needs but cannot find there (e.g. a server-only rule like `@Past`) is an API change, not a UI
   workaround.
2. **Manifest** (`ui-manifest.yaml`). Add `resources.orders` with the same keys as `references/examples/persons/manifest.yaml`:
   - `route`, `nav` (`icon`, `order`) and `display`;
   - `permissions` (`read`, `write`);
   - `list`: `defaultSort`, `pageSize`, `pageSizes`, `columns` (`field` or a dot path such as `address.city`,
     `sortable`, `format: date | enum | badge`, `enum`, `badge` and `mobile: subtitle`) and `filters` (`param`,
     `input: select | date | country`, `enum`). The first column is the table's link to the detail page; put the most
     identifying field first, then the most important ones: from 768 px the table scrolls inside its frame when it is
     wider than the screen, and later columns are the ones that go out of view (an edge fade shows they exist);
   - `detail.fields` (a nested object is one labelled block) and `detail.related` (`resource`, `filter`, `limit`: records
     of another resource that point to this one);
   - `form`: `groups` (rows, or `{ object, groups }` for a nested object's fieldset), `fields` (`input: text | textarea |
     number | date | select | checkbox | country | relation`, `enum`, `allowEmpty`, `notBefore`, and for a relation
     `resource` + `from`; nested fields keyed by their path) and `readOnly` (server-set fields under the edit form);
   - `formats` (`date | dateTime | number`) for fields that are neither columns nor inputs (e.g. `createdAt`);
   - columns and filters can be relations: `format: relation, resource: <key>` / `input: relation, resource: <key>`;
     a boolean filter is `input: boolean` with an `enum` for its two labels (`enums.<Enum>.true/false`).
   - Defaults for new records need no manifest key: they come from the contract's `default` through the generated Zod
     schema.

   Then:
   - add `'orders'` to `ResourceKey` in `src/manifest/index.ts`;
   - add one line to `src/api/sources.ts` (`list`, `get`, `listKey` from the generated client) so other resources
     can relate to it;
   - add any new `nav.icon` name to `src/manifest/icons.ts`.

   Ask when a decision is missing; do not guess.
3. **i18n.**
   - Create `src/locales/{pl,en}/orders.json` with `title`, `newTitle`, `editTitle` (`{{name}}`), `empty`,
     `fields.<field>` (nested: `fields.<object>.<field>`), `groups.<object>` and `filters.<param>`.
   - Add new enums to `src/locales/{pl,en}/enums.json` as `<EnumName>.<VALUE>`.
   - Register the namespaces in `src/i18n/resources.ts`.

   `src/i18n/locales.test.ts` fails if a label the manifest needs, an enum, or a PL/EN key is missing.
4. **Feature folder.** Copy `.claude/skills/crud-resource/references/examples/persons/feature/` to `src/features/orders/`, then rename:
   - the generated hooks (`useListOrders`, `useGetOrder`, `useCreateOrder`, `useUpdateOrder`, `useDeleteOrder`);
   - the query key getters (`getListOrdersQueryKey`, `getGetOrderQueryKey`);
   - the Zod bodies (`CreateOrderBody`, `UpdateOrderBody`);
   - the enum consts used for `enumValues`;
   - `getResource('orders')`.

   | File | What it wires |
   |---|---|
   | `routes.tsx` | lazy routes; `RequireRole` with `permissions.read` around everything, `permissions.write` around `new` and `:id/edit` |
   | `PersonsListPage.tsx` | `useListState(resource, List<Resource>sQueryParams)` → generated list hook (`keepPreviousData`) → `SearchInput`, `ListFilters` (with `enumValues` for select filters), `DataTable`, `Pagination` inside `DataState` (the empty state with filters offers "Clear filters"); `clampPage` effect; New button if `canWrite` |
   | `PersonDetailPage.tsx` | `useIdParam` (bad id → 404), `errorPageFor` (403/404), `DetailList`, Edit/Delete if `canWrite`, `ConfirmDialog` naming the record, cache update and toast, a 404 on delete counts as success |
   | `PersonFormPage.tsx` | create and edit pages around `ResourceForm`; edit uses `UpdateBody.omit({ version: true })` and sends `version` from `ResourceForm` |
5. **Router.** Spread `ordersRoutes` into the root children in `src/router.tsx`, before the `*` route.
6. **Tests.** Copy the relevant cases from `references/examples/persons/persons.spec.ts`:
   - use `test.use({ storageState: authFile('writer') })` and `openAs`;
   - create data through the API with a unique tag;
   - cleanup runs in `afterEach`.

   Add unit tests only for new generic code.
7. **Definition of Done** (`CLAUDE.md`):
   - checks;
   - Playwright MCP at 375/768/1440 px, writer and reader, every language of `app.languages`;
   - the `ui-reviewer` agent;
   - e2e;
   - README.

### Shared pieces (use, do not copy)

| Need | Use |
|---|---|
| Page title + actions | `components/app/PageHeader` (also sets `document.title`) |
| Loading / empty / error with retry | `components/app/DataState`, `list/ListSkeleton` |
| 403/404 from a query error | `components/app/errorPageFor` |
| URL list state, back-to-list link | `list/listState` (`useListState`, `useListHref`) |
| Search, filters, table/cards, paging | `list/SearchInput`, `list/ListFilters`, `list/DataTable`, `list/Pagination` |
| Detail fields | `components/app/DetailList` (formatting via `formatValue`: `formatFieldValue` text, `renderFieldValue` with badges) |
| Country picker | `components/app/CountrySelect` (codes in `lib/countries`, names from `Intl.DisplayNames`) |
| Relation picker, related records | `components/app/RelationSelect`, `components/app/RelatedList` (`RelatedLists`), both via `api/sources` |
| Delete failure toast (`in-use`) | `toastDeleteError` from `components/app/deleteError` |
| Nested values | `getPath`, `objectFields`, `formFieldPaths` from `@/manifest` |
| Form | `form/ResourceForm` (fields, resolver, server errors, stale reload, unsaved guard, toasts) |
| Delete confirmation | `components/app/ConfirmDialog` |
| Roles | `useRoles` from `@/auth`, `canRead`/`canWrite` from `@/manifest` |
| Record name | `formatDisplay(resource.display, record)` |
| Labels built at runtime | `tDynamic`, `fieldLabelKey`, `enumLabelKey`, `groupLabelKey`, `filterLabelKey` from `@/i18n/dynamic` |
| Route id | `useIdParam` from `@/lib/ids` |

## 2. Persons-specific code, and why it exists

Everything else is generic and driven by the manifest. These are the only persons-specific parts:

- **`src/features/persons/*`** (356 lines; 314 before step 9a, which added the filter wiring and the `in-use` toast,
  and the related tasks card in 9b).
- **`src/features/tasks/*`** (353 lines, step 9b): a rename of the persons folder. Only **4 lines** differ beyond the
  rename: the imports and values of `enumValues` and `filterValues`. The other 9b work (number, textarea, checkbox,
  read-only fields, defaults, relations, boolean and relation filters, related lists) went into generic code.
- **Skill fixes** (bullets changed in `SKILL.md` + `references/wiring.md`, listed in each commit): 9a **9** (4 + 5),
  9b **8** (3 + 5). None was a wrong step; all were missing ones: registrations (`sources.ts`), new shared pieces to
  point to, a rename that works on macOS, and test helpers. The screens themselves needed no task-specific code
  beyond the 4 lines above, so the method repeats; the skill still grows with each new capability. Generated hooks and schemas have resource-specific names, and orval's
  types differ per resource, so a page cannot pick them up from the manifest without losing type safety. The pages
  only wire those hooks to shared components.
  - An `api:` block with operationIds was meant to make this generic. Nothing read it, so it was removed (section 4).
- **`useOnSaved` and the delete handler.** Cache updates need the generated query key getters, which have
  per-resource names.
- **`enumValues`** (`{ gender: Object.values(PersonCreateRequestGender), status: … }`) and the list's `filterValues`
  (`{ status: Object.values(ListPersonsStatus) }`). Allowed enum values live in the generated model, not the manifest.
  The manifest only names the i18n enum (`enum: Gender`).
- **`ListPersonsQueryParams`** passed to `useListState`: it validates filter values from the URL against the contract.
- **`UpdatePersonBody.omit({ version: true })`.** The form never shows `version`; `ResourceForm` keeps it and passes it
  to `save`.
- **Registration.**
  - `ResourceKey` (`src/manifest/index.ts`): keeps `getResource` typed;
  - `src/i18n/resources.ts`: JSON imports are static;
  - `src/router.tsx`: lazy routes per feature.
- **Locale files** `persons.json` and the `Gender` enum labels.

**Library UI (`library-api` 1.0.0, Authors and Books):** `src/features/authors/*` and `src/features/books/*` are
347 lines each, a rename of the tasks example minus its enum wiring (no enums in this API). No generic code changed;
the manifest covered both resources.

## 3. Problems met and how they were solved

| Stage | Problem | Fix |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | `@hookform/resolvers@6` failed `npm install` (ERESOLVE on optional `effect` peers) | pinned `@hookform/resolvers@5.9.2`, which supports Zod 4 |
| 1 | TS 6 deprecates `baseUrl` | `paths` without `baseUrl` |
| 2 | The generated Zod schema had a Java-only regex `(?s)` from `@Pattern`, which crashed at import | fixed in the API (contract 3.0.0); `src/api/contract.test.ts` imports the schemas so CI catches it |
| 2 | The contract at first had optional response fields, `*/*` responses and a partial PUT | API Stage 0 (3.0.0): required fields, `application/json`, PUT replaces the record and sends `version` |
| 3 | Without `.env.local` the app hung on login | `requireEnv` names the missing `VITE_OIDC_*` variable; login errors render the error page |
| 3 | After login the original query string was lost (router transition race on the callback URL) | `RequireAuth` renders nothing while the URL still has `code`/`error` + `state` |
| 3 | "Sign in again" after a failed callback looped | `returnToFromLocation` strips OIDC callback params |
| 3 | ESLint `react-hooks/refs` flagged RHF `field` objects and a ref read in render | destructure `useController` fields; capture focus in `onOpenAutoFocus` |
| 4 | `useBlocker` needs a data router | switched to `createBrowserRouter`; `AuthProvider` gets `router.navigate` |
| 4 | Server field errors could not take focus while inputs were disabled during submit | only the submit button is disabled |
| 4 | **Lost update:** a background refetch (window focus) moved `version` under an open form, so a conflicting save succeeded | `ResourceForm` captures `version` once and changes it only on Reload; e2e fires `visibilitychange` before saving |
| 4 | An old link to `page=2` showed "no records" | `clampPage` moves to the last page; the deep-link e2e uses sort + search instead of a page number |
| 4 | Failed e2e runs left test data | `afterEach` deletes through the API with the session token, even after a failure |
| 4 | Mobile cards read "Smith John" (two `primary` columns) while titles used `display` | cards use `display` (user decision) |
| 4→3.1 | Server field messages were hard-coded English | API 3.1 adds `errors[].code`; the UI shows `common.validation.<code>` and re-translates it on a language switch |
| 3.1 | Reviewer: a field error without `code` was dropped, so a duplicate-email 409 looked like a stale version | the fetcher keeps it with code `invalid` |
| 5 | Playwright `storageState` does not save `sessionStorage`, where the OIDC user lives | save the Keycloak SSO cookie instead; `openAs` lets Keycloak redirect back without the form. Logout tests use their own fresh login so they never end the shared session |
| any | The Playwright MCP tab sometimes ignored clicks | open a fresh tab (harness glitch, not an app bug) |
| 9a | Zod 4 skips `.refine`/`.superRefine` on an object when a field already has an issue, so a cross-field error showed only after the other fields were fixed | `formResolver` adds each `notBefore` rule with `refine(..., { when: () => true })` |
| 9a | `FieldError.field` became optional (`in-use` has no field) | `applyApiError` sends errors without a field to the form alert; the delete toast explains `in-use` |
| 9a | An e2e assertion `getByText('Not provided')` broke once more fields could be empty | assert next to the field's label (`dt` → `dd`), not on a text that many fields share |
| 9a | The shadcn Sheet's default close button has no accessible name and a 16 px target | `showCloseButton={false}` plus a labelled icon `Button` in `SheetHeader`, as in `AppShell` |
| 9a | Six columns with a long email do not fit at 768 px, even with cells capped at 14rem | the table scrolls inside its own frame (`overflow-x-auto` in `ui/table`); the page never scrolls sideways (user decision) |
| 9a | The reviewer found the scroll undiscoverable at every width below 1440 px: macOS hides scrollbars and Status, City and Date of birth were silently off-screen | user chose: Status moved before Email in the manifest (the important columns go first), and `DataTable` fades the edge that has more columns (`useHorizontalOverflow`, `ScrollHint`); truncating cells was rejected |
| 9a | `getByRole('link', { name: 'New' })` matched a mobile card of a "Newer …" person made by a parallel test | exact names for short button and link labels (`exact: true`) |
| 9b | `fetcher.ts` dropped API errors without `field`, so `in-use` arrived as a 409 with no errors: the generic delete toast, and in a form the stale-version dialog | `field` is optional (absent or `null`) in `isFieldError`; unit test with `field: null` |
| 9b | Zod 4 fills `_zod.bag` lazily, so number limits read from it were empty | `numberLimits` reads `minValue`/`maxValue` and the `multiple_of` check |
| 9b | cmdk names its option list "Suggestions" (English) even with a `label` on `Command` | pass `label` to `CommandList` too (the 9a fix was incomplete) |
| 9b | BSD `sed` (macOS) has no `\b`, so the rename of the copied feature folder silently skipped most names | rename with a word-boundary-aware script (wiring.md), then grep the new folder for the old names |
| 9b | Shared Polish labels must fit every resource: "Nowy" agreed with "osoba" but not with "zadanie" | `common.*` labels in PL are gender-neutral ("Dodaj"); messages with `{{name}}` avoid gendered verbs |
| 9b | Tests deleting a person before its task failed cleanup (409 `in-use`) | e2e cleanup deletes newest first; API helpers moved to `e2e/support/data.ts` |
| 9b | Reviewer: Enter after a search in the relation picker picked nothing, or "none" from the previous list (cmdk keeps the old highlight while the debounced search is pending) | `RelationSelect` controls the highlight: none while the search is pending, then the first result |
| 9b | Reviewer: a field-less server error showed its English `message`, and a 5xx showed "Internal Server Error" in the form | whole-record errors are translated from their code; status ≥ 500 shows `common.errors.unexpectedText` |
| 9b | Reviewer: validation limits read "0.5" in Polish, and a step violation fell back to "not valid" | the Zod error map formats limits with `Intl` and has `common.validation.step` (`not_multiple_of`) |
| 9b | Reviewer: a long free-text title in the link column pushed every other column out of view | the link column wraps (`min-w-48 max-w-96`) |
| 9b | An API bug found by the UI review: the fix had to come from the API repo, but the UI still had to follow it | flow in CLAUDE.md "API contract": reproduce, prompt for the API repo, `test.fixme`; after the fix pull + regenerate (version-only), regression test |
| 9b | **API bug:** `PUT /api/tasks/{id}` with a new `assigneeId` committed and then answered 500 (lazy `assignee` read after the transaction, `open-in-view: false`), so the next save met the stale-version dialog | fixed in the API repo (3.4.1, which also returns Problem Details for unexpected errors); the UI only regenerated the client. The e2e test changes the assignee and saves again |

`tasks/lessons.md` has no entries: there were no user corrections. The decisions the user made are in the table
above and in the git log.

Known gaps, left as is:
- **Template (step 10 review):** buttons are 44px below `md` and 36px from `md`, so at 768-1023 px (sheet menu, touch
  devices) the header buttons are 36px. It meets the written rule ("touch targets on mobile"); kept as a decision.
- **Open from the step 9a review (user: "commit as is"):**
  - the mobile filter sheet applies filters live and closes only with its X; no "Show results" button;
  - native date inputs (`availableOn`, the form dates) show the browser's date format, not the app language;
  - with both a search term and a filter set, the empty state shows only the filters message;
  - after a delete on the detail page, one extra `GET` of the deleted record returns 404 (probably older than 9a);
  - the delete dialog once did not open on the first click right after a re-login (not reproduced; most likely the
    Playwright MCP browser without OS focus, where Radix closes menus and dialogs at once: `page.bringToFront()`);
  - the e2e test "a birth date in the future…" failed once under parallel load and passed in every later run;
  - the `status` column sorts by enum code, like `gender`;
- **Open from the step 9b review:**
  - `tasks.fields.done` reads "Done: Open" in the list and detail; a separate list/detail label ("State") would need a
    manifest key for per-view labels;
  - the `in-use` toast says "used by other records" without naming the related resource (the API sends no resource);
  - the related list puts the title and badges in one wrapping row, unlike the list's cards;
  - a relation link in the detail is an inline text link (19 px tall at 375 px; allowed by WCAG for inline links);
- the gender column sorts by enum code, not by label (API behaviour; the user kept it sortable);
- user-menu labels are not read by screen readers;
- a server `past` error is cleared by a client-side re-validation until the next save;
- the API reports birth-date errors before duplicate-email errors, so the user sees them one save at a time.

- **Fixed after the Library build:** the related list on an author's page repeated the author's name on every book.
  `relatedSubtitleFields` (`components/app/relatedFields.ts`) now leaves out a relation column that points back to the
  record being shown; the same fix is in `crud-ui-blueprint`.
- **E2E label collision (Library build):** a relation input labelled "Author" and its picker's search box, labelled
  with the related resource's title "Authors", both match `getByRole('combobox', { name: 'Author' })` while the picker
  dialog is open or closing. Wait for `getByRole('dialog')` to be hidden before asserting the input (books.spec.ts).

## 4. `ui-manifest.yaml`: what was missing, what is unused

**Added in step 9b (Tasks):**
- Inputs `textarea`, `number` (min/max/step from the generated schema), `checkbox` and `relation` (`resource`, `from`);
  `form.readOnly`; `formats`; `format: relation` columns; `boolean` and `relation` filters; `detail.related`.
- `src/api/sources.ts`: one registration line per resource, so generic code can list and get another resource.

**Added in step 9a (Person changes):**
- Dot paths in `columns[].field` and `form.fields` keys (`address.city`), `{ object, groups }` fieldsets in `form.groups`;
  a nested field in `detail.fields` is one labelled block.
- `format: badge` with `badge: { VALUE: <shadcn Badge variant> }` on a column; it applies wherever the field is shown.
- `input: country` (form and filter) and the matching `country` format.
- `notBefore: <field>` on a form field: a client `date-range` rule plus the native `min`.
- `list.filters` (`param`, `input`, `enum`).

**Added during the build:**
- `enum: <EnumName>` on enum columns and form fields. Field labels can be derived from the field name; enum labels
  cannot.
- The `mobile:` comment now says that the card title is `display`.

**Removed as unused:**
- `api:` (`tag`, `list`, `get`, …): nothing read it. The feature files import the generated hooks by name.
- `list.rowClick: detail`: only one behaviour existed, and nothing branched on it.
- `list.search: q`: `listState` and `SearchInput` always use `q`, and only one search box exists.
- `mobile: primary | secondary | hidden` became an optional `mobile: subtitle`. Cards are titled by `display` and
  the table links through the first column, so `primary` only picked the link column and `hidden` was the default.

**Still redundant (kept, because removing it needs code that reads the contract at runtime):**
- `format: date` and `input: date` repeat `format: date` from the contract.
- `input: select` repeats the contract enum. Only the i18n enum name (`enum: Gender`) is new information.

**Missing (needed by the next resource, or hard-coded today):**
- ~~Read-only fields~~: done in 9b (`form.readOnly`, `formats`). **Create-only fields** are still missing.
- ~~Default values for new records~~: done in 9a, from the contract `default` through the generated Zod schema.
- ~~Input types beyond text, date and select~~: number, textarea and checkbox done in 9b; an email keyboard
  (`type=email`) is still missing.
- **A searchable-fields hint** for the search placeholder. The API decides what `q` matches.
- **The app name.** "Person UI" is in `index.html` and `common.appName`/`documentTitle`, not in the manifest.
- ~~Relations between resources~~: done in 9b (`input/format: relation`, relation filters, `detail.related`).
  Sorting by a relation column is not offered: the contract does not document a sort key for it.
